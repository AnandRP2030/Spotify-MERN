  <h1>Spotify Clone</h1>
  <p> This is a part of a previous collaborative project, a Spotify clone built by a team of four members, including myself. Initially, we only created the frontend. However, in this project, I connected the frontend with the backend using Express, MongoDB, and Node.js. The end result is a full-stack web application that mimics some of the basic functionalities of Spotify, such as playing songs, adding songs to favorites, creating playlists, and searching for songs..</p>
